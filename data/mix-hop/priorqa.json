Typically, photosynthesis occurs during the day when there is sunlight available for the plants to capture energy. However, some plants, like certain types of cacti and succulents, have adapted to perform a form of photosynthesis at night called CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) photosynthesis. During the night, these plants open their stomata to take in carbon dioxide and store it as organic acids. Then during the day, the stored carbon dioxide is used in the photosynthetic process. This adaptation allows these plants to conserve water by minimizing water loss through evaporation during the day. CAM photosynthesis is an evolutionary advantage for plants living in arid environments with limited water availability. It is a fascinating adaptation that allows these plants to thrive in challenging conditions.",

            "theory of evolution": "The theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century, revolutionized the field of biology and our understanding of the natural world. It posits that species change over time through the process of natural selection, where individuals with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. This leads to the gradual accumulation of adaptations and the formation of new species. Darwin's theory challenged the prevailing belief in special creation and provided a unifying explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. It has since become the foundation of modern biology and has been supported by extensive evidence from various fields, including genetics, paleontology, and comparative anatomy. The theory of evolution has also sparked ongoing debates, particularly in relation to religious beliefs and societal implications, but its significance in shaping our understanding of the natural world cannot be overstated.",
            "construction of the Great Wall of China": "The construction of the Great Wall of China began over 2,000 years ago during the Qin Dynasty and continued through various dynasties until the Ming Dynasty. The wall was originally built as a series of smaller walls to protect against invasions from nomadic tribes in the north. It was not until the Ming Dynasty that the separate walls were connected and fortified into the iconic structure that we recognize today. The Great Wall spans over 13,000 miles and is one of the most impressive architectural feats in history. It is made up of various materials including stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. The labor force responsible for building the wall included soldiers, peasants, and prisoners, many of whom died during the construction.
